<span>Speed, scale and quality are the three pillars of the Iress Technology
        strategy, advocated by Andrew Todd, our Chief Technology Officer. Our
        Health Metrics initiative aims to identify areas where there is an
        opportunity to lift engineering capability, leading to improved speed,
        scale and quality.</span>

<span>Your squad’s ability to operate as a Product Engineering

<span>Most squads organise a half-day workshop to explore the Squad
                Health Metric questions, debate the assessment for each metric
                and create an initial assessment file.</span>

<span>Most squads organise a two-hour workshop every three months to
                review the Squad Health Metric questions and reevaluate the
                assessments for the squad.</span>

<span>Most squads use their Retrospective meetings to brainstorm and
                agree experiments to improve their health metrics. These
                sessions should take no more than three hours every month.</span>
