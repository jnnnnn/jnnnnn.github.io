1	root	Open hold	Basic	Open hold	easy, basic	Week 1			Holding hands, step sideways to BL (boy's left) on 1, bring BRfoot together on 2. Repeat in same direction for total of four counts. Girl mirrors. Complete 8-beat phrase (two bars) by stepping to BR (just tap your foot on 4 and 8, no weight transfer because you're about to step on it on the next beat). Tips: Don't bounce! Shoulders stay on same level. Push knees forward as they take weight to get the swaying motion -- hips go alternately up and down, not side-to-side. Upper body (not just shoulders) can also sway horizontally side-to-side (no vertical movement -- isolate ribs).

9	3	Open hold	Girl turn	Hammerlock	easy, turn	Week 2			Turn on 1, keeping BRH very low. Keep contact with both hands. Boy should keep girl's hand very close to her butt with her arm almost straight and flip his palm downward while she is facing away to avoid twisting her arm (practise as a follow to see how to do this comfortably). Girl will end up in hammerlock (one arm behind her back). Girl should complete the full 360 degree turn. To allow this, boy should offset himself to the girl's right so he is not pulling on the hammerlocked arm.

29	root	Close hold	Basic	Close hold	easy, basic	Week 4	2014-01-23		BRH on GLshoulderblade or teres major, supporting her slightly (girl can lean into the support a bit for a stronger connection). GLH on boy's shoulder. Keep BRelbow up so girl can feel frame at all times -- no gaps anywhere between these arms, from GLshoulder to BRshoulder. BLH and GRH extended -- girl's elbow cupped in boy's elbow. GRA should press outward slightly so boy can move her around if he wants to (boy shouldn't squeeze though. Feet interleaved, inside of right knees making contact. BRelbow must stay up so girl can feel frame -- which will probably be hard work, but you won't be able to do some of the fun stuff without this as a foundation. If boy is too tall to keep his elbow up, squat enough that you can keep your right arm horizontal anyway without straining the girl.

778	362,600	Hammerlock crosshand	Girl wrong-way turn + flick + boy turn	Crosshand	hard, turn	TSF Level 3	2015-05-26		On 1, Girl locked with GLH. Step BL on 1 then GTL to BR, flick BLH (GRH) as BRT. Total 4 counts.
779	362	Crosshand	Girl turn + boy turn	Boy hammerlock	hard, turn	TSF Level 3	2015-05-26		On 5, girl continues to turn in same direction. BLH stays low after girl's turn as BRT.

781	41	Embrace	Hip grind	Embrace	body, fun	TSF Level 2	2015-05-27	https://youtu.be/nC-VsjkH4pc?t=28s	Sway sideways on 1, 2, then step forward with BLF on 3, moving girl's hips further away with one or both hands, and twisting about 30°. Should create quite a lot of space between partners. Sway her hips toward and away (lead with one hip or the other; not front-on) from boy on 5, 6 in a figure-of-8 pattern, then step back to return to neutral position. If you're holding her lower rib cage, don't squeeze too hard -- better to hold her actual hips, or lead it one-handed with BLH on her lower back and BRA supporting her frame. Boy's hips should also do a figure-of-8 in the same direction (not towards her, this is not lombada)
782	12	Cliffhanger	Girl walk forward	Hammerlock crosshand	turn, swap	TSF Level 2	2015-05-27		Girl walks forward past boy and half turns.
783	251	Close hold	Hexagon walk	Close hold	tango	Jose May	2015-05-30		Origin: tango. Start basic on 1 but don't move right foot on 2, step diagonally forward-right (around the outside of the girl) on 3. Lead girl by rotating boy's frame. Tap on 4 then step diagonally-forward left, left, and diagonally back. Complete hexagon. Can also reverse direction or just rock back and forward on a diagonal.
784	251	Close hold	Hexagon parade	Close hold	tango	Jose May	2015-05-30		When rocking back and forward on a diagonal, rotate the girl 180° on every second beat so she is always moving forward. Girl should sweep her foot around close to the floor (leg extended, no raised knees), and pivot with both feet together.
785	784	Close hold	Tango bow	Close hold	tango	Jose May	2015-05-30		Side-by-side with girl, step forward with right on 5, drift on 6, forward left on 7, then turn left away from girl: back right on 8, more back left on 1. Pulling girl with you so she gets closer as you turn away from her. Lean to boy's right on 1, tango-style (stick hip out the other way, boy's left arm raised, frame strong). Can then hold the pose and squeeze her slightly with right forearm so that she drags her left foot up your leg.
786	736,587	Wrap	Bow	Wrap	hard, fun	Mar2015	2015-06-02		Bring girl's arms up to her shoulders (boy's arms crossed behind her). She then leans forward from the waist, keeping her back straight and arms out behind her with boy holding her hands.
787	451	Awkward wrap	Awkward dip	Awkward wrap		filler	2015-06-02		While she's awkwardly wrapped, lean her backwards, supporting her with your arm. Lead by tugging her shoulder back. Do not force it, the lead is a suggestion only.

800	729	Mates hold	Float jump	Mates hold	aerial	Aerials 1	2015-06-21		Boy holds girl gently by hip bones. Both squat then she jumps really high by putting her weight on boy's wrists (with her hands). One of the safer aerials.
801	800,157	Mates hold	Girl stands on boy's thighs	Mates hold	hard, aerial	Aerials 1	2015-06-21		Boy places hands on front of girl's hip bones. She holds his wrists and puts her weight on them to jump onto his lower thighs. Boy squats for her to stand on and leans her forward. Try this with a spotter standing to catch the girl to start with. 
802	800	Open hold	Back-to-back fish lift	Open hold	hard, aerial	Aerials 1	2015-06-21	https://youtu.be/FF_EktxQl-g?t=2m52s	Do not lead socially, nearby people might get kicked. Standing back to back, girl puts her right armpit over boy's left shoulder, lock arms. Boy arches back so girl can sit on his lower back, then lift her into the air and spin her around. Girl's trailing leg fully extended, leading leg crouched. Nice to land and use remaining momentum to face each other. Also known as "teapot".
803	800	Cliffhanger	Cartwheel	Cliffhanger	hard, aerial	Aerials 1	2015-06-21		Don't do this socially, you might kick someone. Boy squats, girl cartwheels with her shoulders on his thighs while boy guides her with hands on her waist. Girl faces front (away from boy). One of the safer aerials.
804	800	Crosshand	Rock-and-roll backflip	Side-by-side	hard, aerial	Aerials 1	2015-06-21		Do not lead socially, nearby people might get kicked. Attempt with a spotter first, who is responsible for stopping girl from falling on her head if boy does not flip her fast enough. A second spotter can catch her if he flips too hard and she falls backwards after. Starting with left hand on top, turn girl to her left. BRA goes across her front (near hips) and BLH behind and just above GLknee. Girl should be centred between the boy's feet. Both squat then boy lifts quite hard with his left arm, girl keeps her knees together, she does a backflip around boy's right arm. Girl should just rest her hands on boy's arm, don't hold his left shoulder or grip tightly.
805	800	Close hold opened	Supergirl	Side-by-side	hard, aerial	Aerials 1	2015-06-21	https://youtu.be/FF_EktxQl-g?t=2m28s	Do not lead socially, nearby people might get kicked. Standing side-by-side, boy puts BRA across girl's hips to hold GRthigh, then girl backflips onto boy's shoulder. Boy supports GLshoulder with BLH. Easiest exit is girl's shoulders under BLarm (girl can hold boy's hips while upside-down). Boy should test girl's weight to make sure he is strong enough before attempting this.
806	805	Cliffhanger	Lifted crucifix	Open hold	elite, aerial	Aerials 1	2015-06-21		Do not lead socially, nearby people might get kicked. Attempt with a spotter first. Build up to this with a handstand on boy's thigh.  Girl plants right shoulder (/neck) on boy's right thigh, then kicks her legs up and over his shoulder, rotates around her butt on his shoulder, to end up sitting on his back. Boy needs to lift her waist to help her up (lean forward, but don't hurt your back by lifting too hard -- girl needs to help) then grab girl's upper arms to hold her up (boy has his arms straight above his head). Girl needs to hold her weight on her arms (her arms are straight out to the side) and straightens her body. To dismount, girl either slides down boy's back or goes back the way she came up, without the thigh (boy just holds her) (falling backwards is a bit scary).
807	800	Crosshand	Waterfall	Open hold	elite, aerial	youtube	2015-06-29	https://youtu.be/FF_EktxQl-g?t=3m28s	Boy leans forward and girl jumps over his back and around his body.

Practise this one safely -- the risk of girl landing badly (on her head or butt) are high. Carefully plan how much rotational momentum boy is going to give when girl is on his shoulder. Practise with two spotters to catch girl in case things go badly.

859	682,474	Control hold	Cross on two	Control hold	tango	Teri/David	2015-09-10		Boy: step left on 1 as normal, then pivot whole body (keeping feet aligned with body) on left toes and cross right foot behind to step on 2. Lift arms to shoulder height on 1 to indicate something weird happening, then lower them again on 2. Straighten up back to facing each other on 3, tap on 4 as usual. If girl's frame is strong she will rotate and step across herself as well.
860	474	Embrace	Hesitation pivot	Embrace	tango, fast	Teri/David	2015-09-10		Boy: step left on 1 as normal, then pivot whole body 90° to the right on two on the ball of BRF. Heel of BRF lands on 2.5 ("two-and"). Girl should rotate as well. On three, girl steps backwards and boy steps forward, rotating back to close hold on 4.
861	467,684	Crosshand	Girl turn + neck roll	Neck hold	body	Teri/David	2015-09-10		BLH on top, BLH to shoulder at start of turn on 5. For neck roll, wait until girl has finished turn. Lift arm so it doesn't hit her head. Do not slide palm around. Fingers press at base of neck (trapezius muscle) and hand feels like it is rotating around wrist. 
862	417	Neck hold	Body roll	Neck hold	body	Teri/David	2015-09-10		Lead (don't pull) her neck toward you to start the roll. Start with your little finger at the base of her neck and tap with each finger (all four fingers with half a second), <300grams force.
863	451,695	Embrace	Squat + hip isolations	Embrace	body	Teri/David	2015-09-10		With the girl facing to your right, squat or dip her slightly then indicate hip isolations with your right hand -- hold her frame (shoulders/upper body) still.

Pretty difficult to lead. Squat slightly and do another chest pop on 2 while squatted. Movements are small because there isn't much time. End with a rondez to the left on 3, 4.
865	567	Close hold opened	Body rolls	Close hold opened	body, fun	filler	2015-09-28		This one is all in the timing. Move boy's frame to BL to lead a slow body roll -- move her upper body forward on 1, back on 2 to complete one roll, then flow straight into a second one on 3 but pause half-way through on 4 (with her frame forward). Complete the pattern by moving her frame back-forward-back on 5-6-7.

869	368	Close hold	Drop and wiggle	Close hold	body	Jai	2015-10-14		Leading this clearly requires full body contact (with the boy twisted away slightly to make it less creepy), don't try it unless that will be comfortable for both partners.

Lift your arm at the last minute so she doesn't headbutt it, but not too early -- lead it with your hand on the base of her neck, not by making an opening with your arm and hoping she puts her head through it.
