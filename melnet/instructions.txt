0. Clone this repository to your local machine. Install python 3 if you haven't already.
1. Download a GTFS dataset. If you don't use Melbourne, you will need to generate a new background map (or just remove it) and uncomment the call to layout() to automatically fit to the geographical coordinates.
2. If it's a zip file, extract everything into gtfs/*. If there are zip files inside the folders, extract those too.
3. If stop_times.txt is >50MB, run splitter.py to cut out a small section.
4. Set parameters at the top of index.html:
	var gtfsdata = "gtfs/4/"; // which dataset to use. For Melbourne, 2 is trains, 3 is trams, 4 is buses.
	var stoptimesfile = gtfsdata+"stop_times-filtered.txt"; // generate a smaller stop_times.txt using splitter.py -- >100MB ones don't work because the browser runs out of memory loading them
	var now = new Date(2017,4,1,10); // date to start from (this is 1 May 2017, 10AM) -- should match splitter.py setting
5. run start_server.bat, and click "melnet" when it opens the index page. You might have to point it to the right python folder (I use anaconda but plain python will be C:\Python35\python.exe)
6. you can turn on routes display by uncommenting rendertracks();
7. you can turn on stops (stations) display by uncommenting renderstations().
