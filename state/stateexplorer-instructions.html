<h1>State transition explorer: Instructions</h1>
Try the following:
<ol>
  <li>Click on a coloured circle to select that state.</li>
  <li>Click on the green text of a transition to select that link.</li>
  <li>Press B or check "Back Links" to show links leading to the current state</li>
  <li>Press "N" to select a link at random</li>
  <li>Wave the mouse over the controls to see hints about what that control does.</li>
</ol>

Less useful controls:
<ol>
  <li>Turn off "Hide unrelated" to show _all_ links (must have Forward and Back links turned on).</li>
  <li>Type a regular expression into the filter box to filter which links are displayed.</li>
  <li>Press P to traverse back through the history of moves</li>
  <li>Press R to select a random state.
  <li>The Trim checkbox will keep the history short, and "Brief" hides the descriptive text.</li>
</ol>

Secret controls:
Click "Brief" and then click on the bold N to generate a long list of transitions!

<h2>How it works</h2>

Most of the work is done by the marvellous <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock">d3js library</a>.
<p>The diagrams are loaded from Tab-Separated-Value files containing at least three columns: Start, Move, and End.</p>
<p>
Start is the starting state of a transition. <br />
Move is some text describing the transition. <br />
End is the final state of the transition.</p>
<p>You can also have a Description column giving some extra information about the transition, that will appear as hovertext and in the move history.</p>
