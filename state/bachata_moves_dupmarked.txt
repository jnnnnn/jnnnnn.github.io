Can then hold the pose and squeeze her slightly with right forearm so that she drags her left foot up your leg.
786	736,587	Wrap	Bow	Wrap	hard, fun	Mar2015	2015-06-02		Bring girl's arms up to her shoulders (boy's arms crossed behind her). She then leans forward from the waist, keeping her back straight and arms out behind her with boy holding her hands.
787	451	Awkward wrap	Awkward dip	Awkward wrap		filler	2015-06-02		While she's awkwardly wrapped, lean her backwards, supporting her with your arm. Lead by tugging her shoulder back. Do not force it, the lead is a suggestion only.

796	800	Open hold	Hair pull faith dip	Open hold	elite, aerial	Alba Ronald	2015-06-23	http://gfycat.com/LivelyExhaustedFoxhound	Watch the video. Be careful. Do not lead socially, too scary.
800	729	Mates hold	Float jump	Mates hold	aerial	Aerials 1	2015-06-21		Boy holds girl gently by hip bones. Both squat then she jumps really high by putting her weight on boy's wrists (with her hands). One of the safer aerials.
801	800,157	Mates hold	Girl stands on boy's thighs	Mates hold	hard, aerial	Aerials 1	2015-06-21		Boy places hands on front of girl's hip bones. She holds his wrists and puts her weight on them to jump onto his lower thighs. Boy squats for her to stand on and leans her forward. Try this with a spotter standing to catch the girl to start with. 
802	800	Open hold	Back-to-back fish lift	Open hold	hard, aerial	Aerials 1	2015-06-21	https://youtu.be/FF_EktxQl-g?t=2m52s	"Do not lead socially, nearby people might get kicked. Standing back to back, girl puts her right armpit over boy's left shoulder, lock arms. Boy arches back so girl can sit on his lower back, then lift her into the air and spin her around. Girl's trailing leg fully extended, leading leg crouched. Nice to land and use remaining momentum to face each other. Also known as ""teapot""."
803	800	Cliffhanger	Cartwheel	Cliffhanger	hard, aerial	Aerials 1	2015-06-21		Don't do this socially, you might kick someone. Boy squats, girl cartwheels with her shoulders on his thighs while boy guides her with hands on her waist. Girl faces front (away from boy). One of the safer aerials.
804	800	Crosshand	Rock-and-roll backflip	Side-by-side	elite, aerial	Aerials 1	2015-06-21		Do not lead socially, nearby people might get kicked. Attempt with a spotter first, who is responsible for stopping girl from falling on her head if boy does not flip her fast enough. A second spotter can catch her if he flips too hard and she falls backwards after. Starting with left hand on top, turn girl to her left. BRA goes across her front (near hips) and BLH behind and just above GLknee. Girl should be centred between the boy's feet. Both squat then boy lifts quite hard with his left arm, girl keeps her knees together, she does a backflip around boy's right arm. Girl should just rest her hands on boy's arm, don't hold his left shoulder or grip tightly.
805	800	Close hold opened	Supergirl	Side-by-side	hard, aerial	Aerials 1	2015-06-21	https://youtu.be/FF_EktxQl-g?t=2m28s	Do not lead socially, nearby people might get kicked. Standing side-by-side, boy puts BRA across girl's hips to hold GRthigh, then girl backflips onto boy's shoulder. Boy supports GLshoulder with BLH. Easiest exit is girl's shoulders under BLarm (girl can hold boy's hips while upside-down). Boy should test girl's weight to make sure he is strong enough before attempting this.
806	805	Cliffhanger	Lifted crucifix	Open hold	elite, aerial	Aerials 1	2015-06-21		Do not lead socially, nearby people might get kicked. Attempt with a spotter first. Build up to this with a handstand on boy's thigh.  Girl plants right shoulder (/neck) on boy's right thigh, then kicks her legs up and over his shoulder, rotates around her butt on his shoulder, to end up sitting on his back. Boy needs to lift her waist to help her up (lean forward, but don't hurt your back by lifting too hard -- girl needs to help) then grab girl's upper arms to hold her up (boy has his arms straight above his head). Girl needs to hold her weight on her arms (her arms are straight out to the side) and straightens her body. To dismount, girl either slides down boy's back or goes back the way she came up, without the thigh (boy just holds her) (falling backwards is a bit scary).
