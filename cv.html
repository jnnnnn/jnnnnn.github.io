                <p>Financial trading software in C++ and python, some C#/C++-cli/Elm/Go/AWS/Kotlin</p>

                <p>At IRESS, I fixed the software that interfaced with the Australian Stock Exchange. This software was under active use by 90% of the Australian sharemarket, and I took it from having a major production issue every week to less than one per year. To do this, I introduced automated unit and integration testing to my team and advocated it to others.</p>

                <p>To support the companyâ€™s continuous delivery ambitions, I drove a migration of several hundred developers working on several thousand C++ projects from Team Foundation Server to Git, including a new toolchain based on TeamCity, Conan and Artifactory.</p>

    <h2 id="computerskills">Computer Skills</h2>

    <p>I have undergone full Software Engineering training covering requirements analysis, architecture design and
        documentation, implementation strategies, software testing, quality control, maintenance strategies
        software
        team and project management.</p>

    <p>I am skilled in C, C++, and Python; competent in Java, Pascal, C#, JavaScript, Bash, and SQL; and have some
        experience with PHP, Haskell, x86 assembly, Kotlin, Elm, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Prolog, OCaml, R, Fortran,
        Matlab, Powershell, and Go. I find I can get up to speed with the syntax of a new language in a few days, and
        get
        comfortable with common libraries within a few weeks.</p>

    <p>I am comfortable in windows, ubuntu, mac, and remote-shell environments.</p>

    <p>I have experience designing, working in and performing long-term maintenance on several large software systems.</p>

    <p>Thanks for your time!</p>
