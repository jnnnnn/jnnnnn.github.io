# Pairing notes from session by Michelle Gleeson

## Every time: Starting a session

- Can you both see the monitor? Get comfortable.
- how long will you be pairing for, when will the breaks be (every 45 minutes)
- when swap? (every ten minutes, every green test, other little goals?)
- talk through the business logic / user story

## Every time: after a session:

- what was hard about the session
- what were the unexpected benefits?
- how can we make it better?

## Key takeaway:

- most benefits realised when you combine pairing, [clean code](https://devblog.xero.com/clean-coding-or-how-to-be-nice-to-your-fellow-developers-dd3a3e024af2) and test-driven-development.

## Why pair?

- whole team accountability
- higher standards
- can go on holiday (no key-man dependency, no bus-factor, no handover)
- continuous handover
- continuous code review
- build strong team relationships (how long does this take?)
- increases inclusion and authenticity
  - story about girl who hated her job until that team started pairing
  - opportunities for juniors to work on critical items
  - everyone learns lots of tips and tricks
- deliberate action: challenge your own thinking
  - story about submarine verbalising routine possibly-dangerous actions

## How to pair?

- no phones
- one monitor
- same thought process
- low level hum of quiet discussion
- if on laptop, plug in a keyboard (no hogging screen)
- mirror displays
- no slack

## Quickstart to get a team used to pairing

- identify why (measurable goals, e.g. 150% improved cycle time)
- agree to a two week experiment
- work through discomfort
- be courageous
- review regularly
  - what's hard
  - what are the unexpected benefits
  - how can we make it better
- block out time in calendar and link slack status to it so you don't get interrupted

## tips and tricks:

- offsite pairing might help
- team charter to make sure values aligned
- development style: use a linter!

## advanced:

- mob once a week. Several developers sitting around a shared TV, passing around the keyboard.
- use a timer to swap
- track who you pair with to make sure you get everyone. Make a chart.
- pairing cycle: make a test pass, refactor, write next (failing) test, pass over the keyboard
- everyone knows what's going on, manager can ask anyone
- team size 4-6 (bigger gets inefficient)

## Roles

There are two roles when pairing. The **driver** types the code or moves the mouse; the **navigator** keeps things on track, watching over the overall design or the bigger picture.

It is important that the navigator is not overly controlling; for example, let typos ride for a minute before pointing them out; the driver might notice them on their own.
