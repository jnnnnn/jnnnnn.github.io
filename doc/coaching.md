## Summary of Coaching Habit by Michael Bungay Stanier

Building a coaching habit will help:

-   your team be more self-sufficient by increasing their autonomy and sense of
    mastery and by reducing your need to jump in, take over and become the
    bottleneck.
-   you regain focus so you and your team can do the work that has real impact
    and so you can direct your time, energy and resources to solving the
    challenges that make a difference.
-   you and your team reconnect to the work that not only has impact but has
    meaning as well

### Key questions

1. What’s on Your Mind?. neither too open and broad nor too narrow and confining
2. And What Else?. more options can lead to better decisions; you rein yourself in; and you buy yourself time
3. What’s the real challenge here for you?. Stop the noise and encourage introspection and realizations.
4. What Do You Want?. Let real communication happen.
5. How can I help? Stop taking responsibility, and let them develop their own problem-solving skills.
6. If You’re Saying Yes to This, What Are You Saying No To?.
7. What Was Most Useful for You?. Embed the learning.

### Quotes I liked

> “So there are three different facets of that we could look at,” you offer.
> “The **project** side—any challenges around the actual content. The **people**
> side—any issues with team members/colleagues/other
> departments/bosses/customers/clients. And **patterns—if** there’s a way that

> Where should we start?”

> Yes, there’s a place for asking “Why?” in organizational life. And no, it’s
> not while you’re in a focused conversation with the people you’re managing.
> Here are two good reasons:
>
> -   You put them on the defensive. Get the tone even slightly wrong and suddenly
>     your “Why… ?” come across as “What the hell were you thinking?” It’s only
>     downhill from there.
> -   You’re trying to solve the problem. You ask why because you want more
>     detail. You want more detail because you want to fix the problem. And suddenly
>     you’re back in the vicious circles of overdependence and overwhelm.

> - T is for tribe. Be on their side, and make sure they know it.
> - E is for expectation. Clear futures are safe.
> - R is for rank. Seniority is safety.
> - A is for autonomy. Real choices result in rewards and therefore safety.

> How to Say No When You Can’t Say No: Say yes more slowly:
>
> -   Whom else have you asked?
> -   When you say this is urgent, what do you mean?
> -   If I couldn’t do all of this, but could do just a part, what part would you have me do?
> -   What do you want me to take off my plate so I can do this?
