## Exercises

### Self-discipline

Every day, do three things that you don't want to do, OR, stop yourself from
doing three things you shouldn't. Keep a record.

- [ ] Provide structure while child, e.g. 9pm bedtime, homework before outside
- [ ] Make sure the rules are clear, age-appropriate and easy to follow
- [ ] The consequences of not following rules must be clear, predictable to the
      child, and appropriately harsh

### Vertical Questioning

Your next question should be geared toward pushing their attention inward and
driving them deeper into their emotions.

### Self-Talk

Things to say:

- "It's only a feeling, and feelings don't last forever.",
- "You know you're a good person.",
- "You know you meant well.",
- "You tried your best, and it didn't work out.",
- "Just wait it out.",
- "This will pass.",
- "I need to figure out what I can learn from this, and then put it behind me.",

### Self-compassion

Principles:

- Do unto yourself as you would unto others
- Notice when you are angry with yourself.
- Speak your wisdom to yourself and take it in.
- Question yourself about what went wrong and how to prevent it from happening
  again.
- Allow yourself to make mistakes.

### Loving-but-firm voice

When talking to yourself, follow these steps:

- Be accountable without blame or judgement
- Which part of the mistake is your fault? (the rest is other people or
  circumstances).
- What to do differently next time?
- What have you learned? (put the mistake behind you)

### Giving and caring

Ideas:

- Hugs when sad
- If she looks upset, ask if she's ok
- Spend extra time with her when she needs it
- During transitions, talk about it
- During transitions, do something special to show that you notice what she's
  going through
- Accept and validate her feelings.

### Emotionally aware

Steps:

- Pay attention and notice what your child is feeling
- Make an effort to feel what your child is feeling
- Demonstrate how to name their feelings
- Apply Vertical Questioning to understand the reasons for his feelings
- Talk about emotions as an everyday thing.

### Identifying feelings

Steps:

- Picture a blank screen.
- "What am I feeling right now?"
- Focus on your internal experience.
- Identify some feeling words.
- Skim the list of feeling words
- "Why would I be feeling \_\_\_ right now?"
- "What is going on in my life right now that might make me feel \_\_\_"
- "Has something happened recently to make me feel \_\_\_"?
- "Has something \_\_\_ from the past been brought back up by recent events?"
- "Is this feeling of \_\_\_\_ familiar to me?"
- "Have I felt this \_\_\_\_ often before?"
- "When and why have I felt \_\_\_\_ before?"
- "Is this an underlying feeling that's often with me?"
- "If so, what's happened in my past that may have caused it in the beginning?"

### Put yourself first

- [ ] Ask for help
- [ ] Assertiveness
- [ ] Say no

### Identify, Accept, Attribute, Act

Talk through what happened, why, what next?

Steps:

- Identify and name the feeling
- Accept but do not judge the feeling.
- Attribute the feeling to a cause
- Act appropriately in response to the feeling.

### Ask for help

Look for a therapist to help you. Particularly if you need help learning
relationship skills; it is not fair to ask your partner to teach you those: it
is tiring and it is difficult for one person to seperate teaching from the
actual relationship.

### Self-soothing

Strategies that have worked for others:

- Bubble bath
- long hot shower
- listen to music you like
- polish your car
- go for a run, lift weights, bike ride
- play an instrument
- cook or bake
- spend time with your pet
- play with a child
- go for a walk
- call a friend
- lie on the ground and watch the clouds or the stars
- clean the house
- go to the movies
- meditate
- self-talk: remind yourself of simple, honest truths.

### Assertiveness

Express your feelings and needs in a way that the other person can hear.

Being too strong (not validating their feelings first; yelling; blaming;
judging) will trigger fight-or-flight and they won't be able to listen.

Being too weak (not saying your side at all) means they don't have anything to
listen to.

Things to remember:

- Start by validating their feelings. Demonstrate your understanding of their
  position.
- The other person will be affected by your expression
- Use words
- Use body language
- Use facial expressions
- Use natural consequences to back yourself up. "If you do this unsafe thing,
  people might get hurt". "If you are mean, people might not help you when you
  ask."

### Nurturing behaviours

- Wanting the best for the other person
- Providing a safe environment for them
- only helping when needed
- accurately predicting how the person is likely to feel
- coaching them through dealing with their feelings
- coaching them to choose productive behaviours
- feeding back their natural likes/dislikes/strengths/weaknesses in a helpful
  way
- think about their emotional needs
- Warm, caring hugs
- Laughter
- Truly enjoying your child's personality
- Teach them how to satisfy all their needs. For a list of needs, see Needs
  tool: [Needs tool](http://jnnnnn.github.io/needs/index.html) -
  [Feelings sunburst](http://jnnnnn.github.io/needs/sunburst.html?data=feelings-tree3.tsv)
  [Cherish sliders](http://jnnnnn.github.io/needs/blank.html?f=cherish.tsv)
  [Cherish wheel](http://jnnnnn.github.io/needs/sunburst.html?data=cherish-tree.tsv)

### Human needs

- physical: air, drink, food, rest, shelter, clean/, exercise, touch, sex
- mental: adventure, challenge, personal space
- interpersonal: appreciation (acts of service), appreciation (gifts),
  appreciation (words), quality time (spending time together)
- autonomy: choosing dreams/goals/values, choosing plans for fulfilling
  dreams/goals/values
- celebration: celebrating creation and success, celebrating losses (mourning)
- integrity: creativity, meaning, self-worth
- interdependence: community, consideration, empathy, honesty (the constructive
  kind), love, respect, support,
- play: fun, laughter
- spirituality: beauty, peace

### Meditate as part of your daily routine

Look at a candle flame for a few minutes. Sit in fully-awake stance. Put timer
on for three minutes. Let your gaze steady on the flame. It's ok if you notice
intrusive thoughts, or your eyes droop or close. The point is to notice
sensations, notice temperature, and use your breath to stay focused. Observe
thoughts non-judgementally, take a breath, and return to the flame.

Every morning or every evening.

It's not easy. Some days will come more easily than others.

## Accept your feelings and trust them

Emotions are not good or bad.

Feelings are not always rational but they can be explained.

Emotions are an efficient survival heuristic.

Emotions can be very powerful, but they can be managed.

## Learnings

- Addicted people are inconsistent. This provokes anxiety in the people around
  them.
- Depressed people are low-energy and cause guilt in others.
- Parents of sick children minimize negative emotions in the rest. Enforced
  maturity that falls apart.
- A sociopathic parent hurts people without guilt.
- Simon had to allow himself to feel emotions.
- Nurturance is a combination of love, care and help.
- A feeling of caring is very important. Cold otherwise.
- Others can tell how you're feeling, and will also feel a bit of it
- Fatal flaws pass to children by osmosis.
- Supportive people are important
  - they believe in you
  - they provide moral support when you begin to doubt yourself
- Reacting instinctively without thought is problematic. Instead, think about
  long-term consequences to behave responsively instead.

### Don't solve problems for people

White-knighting reduces resilience. Don't teach people to come and ask you to
fix things for them. Instead, sit with them while they figure it out.

### Validation is important

Whatever difficulty they are having, appreciate the wider context. Compare to
other experiences.

"This is a difficult thing"

"This is a hard problem"

You've been doing a great job

### Attention bids are important

Questions, touches, open/leading statements, big sighs.. anything where your
partner is wanting you to engage with them.

Respond either by engaging enthusiastically (good) or not (a little crushing for
them).

During a romantic dinner these can happen every six seconds if your relationship
is strong.

- https://www.gottman.com/blog/want-to-improve-your-relationship-start-paying-more-attention-to-bids/

### Stoics vs. Epicureans

- Did this event bring me enjoyment? Did it also bring me meaning?
- Did this make me feel afraid? Did I learn something from this fear that will
  lead to less fear in the future?
- Did this serve my interests? Did it serve the interest of others?

### Motivational interviewing

asking open-ended questions and listening carefully — and holding up a mirror so
they can see their own thoughts more clearly.

If they express a desire to change, you guide them toward a plan.

Sustain talk is commentary about maintaining the status quo.

Change talk is referencing a desire, ability or commitment to making a shift. A
skilled motivational interviewer listens for change talk and asks people to
elaborate on it.

[change someone's mind](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/31/opinion/change-someones-mind.html)

### Emotion is suffering until we form a clear and precise picture of it

This is from "Man's Search For Meaning"

### Dealing with fear

See [a summary of](./fear.md) "Fear Less" by Pippa Grange.

1. Learn to recognise it.

   Describe your fears as stories, using fantasy: "It's like a ..."

   Underneath all your fears is the fear of not being good enough, of being cast
   out and 'abandoned'.

2. Study its effects.

   Not challenging a difficult colleague? Low energy? Stopped trying? Can't stop
   something?

   Stunted relationships? Defensive, overreactive, or withdrawn?

3. Deliberately block and channel it.

   Start thinking in terms of just trying things a bit more. Imagine, decide,
   do, struggle, mess up, renew, look forward, go again.

   Failure is okay. There's no other way to learn.

   Don't hide your mistakes or mess. It happened. it hurt. You don't want more.
   But maybe your heatbreak also revealed some passion. Nothing sensible or
   neat, maybe unusual or weird, but maybe a dream that can take you beyond
   fear.

   Dreams are renewable rocket fuel for creativity and wellbeing.

### Bids for attention

Bids for attention are attempts to connect with our partner when we are seeking
attention, affirmation, or affection. A bid for attention is a way of saying
“please pay attention to me”, “please talk with me”, “please lay with me”, or
“please help me de-stress after the day I’ve had”, without actually asking
explicitly.

| Bid for Attention                           | What Your Partner is Needing                                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| There was so much traffic on my drive home. | I want to chat with you.                                          |
| I ran into Rachel at the store today.       | I want you to hear about my day.                                  |
| Will you watch this movie with me?          | Can we spend time together?                                       |
| How was dinner tonight?                     | I want your affirmation that you liked the dinner I made for you. |
| I need a hug after today.                   | Can I have your affection?                                        |
| Wow, check out the sunset!                  | Can I have your attention?                                        |

You can **respond** to a bid in three ways.

1. **...**: ignore it completely.

   This is the most hurtful response, as it tells your partner that you are not
   interested, and it shuts down connection altogether.

2. **maybe later**

   It is okay to reject a bid, because we cannot expect our partner to be able
   to respond 100% of the time.

   A positive way to reject a bid is to let your partner know that you’ve heard
   them, and that you want to check in with them later when you’re up for it.
   You can simply say, “It sounds like you’ve had a hard day. I really want to
   hear about it, but I’m not feeling up for it at this moment. Can we wait 30
   minutes and then I’ll be ready to give you my attention?” This is not as
   destructive as completely ignoring a bid.

3. **fulfil their need**

   Give your partner what they’re needing from you in that moment. This is where
   the connection comes from!

## Connection concepts

- Empathy: share similar experiences, reinforce shared values, focus on other
  person
- Trust: admit mistakes, apologize sincerely, keep promises, say what you mean,
  say and do together
- Compassion: focus on common ground (seeking safety and happiness, has
  suffered, still learning)
- Kindness: express feelings
- Quality time: walk or talk
- Assertive: talk about your thoughts and feelings
- Honest: about who you are
- Listen: eye contact, don't interrupt, demonstrate respect, open posture
- Know yourself: who am I? what do I love? what would I tell my older self?
- Codependence / Narcissism
- Secure Attachment,
  [lnk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship#Adult_attachment_and_attachment_theory)

  Interpersonal relationships thrive through equitable and reciprocal compromise

  those who are codependent neglect themselves in favor of taking care of others
  and have difficulty fully developing their identity on their own.

- Emotional understanding
- Limerance -- obsession
- Belonging

  The innate human desire to be part of something larger than us. True belonging
  only happens when we present our authentic, imperfect selves to the world.
  Trying to fit in is a barrier. Our sense of belonging can never be greater
  than our level of self-acceptance

- Connection

  The energy that is created between people when they feel seen, heard, and
  valued. When they can give and receive without judgement.

## Motivations to connect

- reach understanding
- offer mutual support
- build a sense of community
- shared duty
- feel comfortable together
- purpose and belonging
- fulfillment (satisfaction with your life)

## Connection tests

### Emotional intimacy scale

The components of an intimate relationship are:

- [ ] This person completely accepts me as I am
- [ ] I can openly share my deepest thoughts and feelings with this person
- [ ] My thoughts and feelings are understood and affirmed by this person
- [ ] This person cares deeply about me
- [ ] This person would willingly help me in any way

### Strange situation

Mother leaves child in strange room for three minutes with researcher. How does
the child cope?

Warm and responsive mothers have children who cope well.

## Actions to improve connection

- Disclose thoughts, feelings and emotions
- Capitalize on positive events
- Express gratitude
- Share appreciation for your partner
- Build trust
- Pay attention to her eyes
- Introspection: who am I? What do I love?
- Build self-confidence
- Be vulnerable in new ways, and that's what love is all about. Are we being our
  most vulnerable selves? Are we showing trust, kindness, affection, and respect
  to our partners?
- Stay on topic: Be in the here and now with the person. Avoid random tangents.

## Seven Principles

(From John Gottman's book about relationships)

1. Love maps. Ask about what's going on in their life every evening, and keep
   track.
2. Admire
3. Turn toward each other ("same team")
4. Let your partner influence you (they need autonomy too)
5. Solve the solvable problems
6. Overcome gridlock
7. Create shared meaning
8. Process regrettable incidents.

### Things that can help

- Learn something about their day before saying goodbye.
- Coming home: hug and a kiss that lasts at least six seconds. 20-minute
  stress-reducing conversation.
- Every day, communicate genuine affection and appreciation.
- Physical affection, hug before sleep.
- Weekly date: ask open-ended questions. 2 hours.
- Weekly meeting, 1 hour: talk about your relationship this week. What went
  well. Five new appreciations. Gentle-start-up and listen nondefensively.
  Problem solving two circle method p185. Process regrettable incident p188.
  Both answer, "what can I do to make you feel loved this coming week?"

### Gridlock

- Explore dreams: Investigate, support, become part of.
- Soothe: alert your partner if you feel stress (prevent flooding)
- Two Circle Method: What can you not yield on without violating basic needs or
  core values? What can your partner not yield on.
- Make a plan
- Reevaluate after two months

### Shared Meaning pillars

- Rituals of Connection. Eat together, weekly routine, yearly events.
  Structured, scripted traditions that you can depend on.
- Support for each other's roles
- Shared goals
- "Shared values and special possessions, stories, pictures.

### Process Regrettable Incident

Steps:

- Choose a specific incident to work through. Both need some emotional distance.
- Decide who will speak first. No interruptions.
- Describe your feelings at the time (but not why)
- Explain why you felt that way and what you needed.
- Identify and explore enduring vulnerabilities; the triggers you are overly
  sensitive to. Describe to your partner the earlier experiences in your life
  that taught you to behave that way.
- Acknowledge your role in what happened.
- Apologise and describe your regrets.
- Accept your partner's apology.
- Identify a thing you could do to avoid it happening again.
- Identify a thing your partner could do to avoid it happening again.

Possible bad feelings:

- Excluded
- Like I was not important
- Cold
- Strongly rejected
- Criticized
- Like I had no affection toward you
- Like you weren't attracted to me
- My sense of dignity was being compromised
- Like I was being bullied
- I could not persuade you at all

Possible triggers: I felt X. I'm very sensitive to that.

- Judged
- Excluded
- Criticized
- Flooded
- Ashamed
- Lonely
- Belittled
- Disrespected
- Powerless
- Out of control
- Hopeless

## School of life: A test to judge how good your parents were

[school of life on youtube](https://youtu.be/6fZXxu8AcTA)

Strangely, and rather awkwardly, it seems no human being can ever really grow up
sane unless it has been loved very deeply by someone for a number of years in
its early life.

But we’re still learning what parental love might actually involve.

So how good were your parents? Here are eight principles of good parenting you
can use to grade them.

### Attunement

A loving parent gets down to the child’s level - at times literally, dropping to
their height when addressing them - in order to see the world through their
eyes.

A loving parent understands that a very young child cannot easily fit in with
external demands and that, in the early days, they must be prioritised and
placed at the center of things, not in order to ‘spoil’ them, but in order to
give them a chance to grow.

### ‘Small Things’

Loving parents understand that their young offspring’s lives revolve around
details that are, by any adult measure, very minor.

Toddlers will feel enormously happy because they can dig their nails into some
putty or have a chance to wack their spoon into some peas with energy or say
‘bah’ very loudly; and they will feel extremely sad because pet rabbit lost one
of its buttons or a page in a favourite book now has a tear in it.

The good enough parent feels sufficiently resourceful inside itself not to hold
it against the child that it is making a very big deal out of so-called
‘nothing’. It will follow the child in its excitement over a puddle and it in
its grief over an uncomfortable sock.

The good enough parent understands that the child’s future ability to be
considerate to other people and to handle genuine disasters will be critically
dependent on having had its ample fill of sympathy for a range of
age-appropriate sorrows.

### Forgiveness

A loving parent will know how to put the best possible interpretation on
behaviour that might seem to others unfortunate and grating.

The small child isn’t ‘a troublemaker’, but it has of course been very upset by
the arrival of its sibling. It isn’t ‘antisocial’ but it does find a small
circle of familiar people especially soothing. It isn’t a ‘nightmare’ but it
does surely need to go to bed very soon.

This capacity for imaginative kindly explanations will go on to mould the
workings of the child’s own conscience; it will learn the art of
self-forgiveness. It won’t have to torture itself for its mistakes. It won’t
suffer the ravages of self-loathing or ever, when it messed up badly, be tempted
to take its own life.

### Strange Phases

The loving parent will feel sufficiently sane to allow a child to be weird for a
while, knowing that so-called weird is part of normal development. It won’t get
flustered that the child has decided to pretend it is an animal or wants to eat
only red-coloured foods or has an imaginary friend living in the tree at the end
of the garden.

The adult will have faith in sanity emerging - and in the wisdom of exploring a
lot of possible options before choosing to settle on reason. It will be able to
remain calm over some intense tantrums and obsessions, it won’t need to shut
down irreverence at every turn, it will be patient around low moods and
unruffled by adolescent surliness.

The parent won’t assign labels to the child that might fix it in a role it was
only trying out. It will be wary of telling a child that it is ‘the angry one’,
‘the little philosopher’ or even ‘the kind one’: it will allow the child the
luxury of picking its own identity.

### Clinginess

The good parent knows that children may well cling for a long while, and will
never dismiss this natural need for reassurance in pejorative terms. It won’t
tell the child to buck up and be a ‘good little man’ or ‘young lady who can make
me proud’. It will know that those who end up securely attached and able to
tolerate absence are those who were originally allowed to have as much
dependence and connection as they needed.

There will be few requests to be ‘brave’ at the school gates.

### Perfection

A good parent won’t set themselves up as impossibly glamorous or remote, a
figure whom a child might be tempted to idealise and ruminate over from afar.
They will know how to be present and very ordinary around the house; dignified
perhaps but also on occasion ratty, forgetful, silly and greedily keen to have
too much desert.

The good parent will know that parental quirks and flaws are there to remind a
child to reconcile itself to its own humanity - and also eventually to leave
home and get on with their own lives.

### Boringness

A good parent will know how to appear very boring. It will understand that what
a child chiefly needs is a source of reliable calm, not fireworks and excitement
(it has enough of these inside its own mind). It should be there, in the same
place, saying more or less the same things, for decades. It should take care to
be predictable and to edit out its surprising moods. The child doesn’t need a
full picture of every perturbance and temptation coursing through its carers’
minds.

The parent accepts that ‘mummy’ or ‘daddy’ are roles, not full representations;
it should be the privilege of every child not to have to know its parents in
complete detail.

### Unreciprocated Love

The good parent isn’t looking for a balanced relationship. It is happy to give
unilaterally. It doesn’t need to be asked how its day was or what it thinks of
the government’s new policy on insurance. It knows that a child should be able
to take a parent substantially for granted.

The parent’s reward for all their work won’t ever be direct; it will arrive by
noting, in many years time, that their child has developed into a very good
parent themselves.

Put simply: love is the considerate, tender, hugely patient behaviour displayed
by an adult over many years towards a child who cannot help but be largely out
of control, confused, frustrating and bewildered - in order that it might over
time grow into an adult who can take its place in society without too much of a
loss of spontaneity, without too much terror and with a basic trust in its own
capacities and chances of fulfilment.

## School of Life: How to spot Emotionally Immature People

https://youtu.be/XdE17nu0zdo

### Otherwise healthy people can be immature

The best thing about physical maturity is that it’s very easy to spot; we can so
easily tell when someone has another decade of growth to go – and can therefore
set our expectations, and our levels of forbearance accordingly.

But we have no such luxury when it comes to emotional maturity.

Here we can be constantly surprised by whom we have on our hands.

The most stunning forms of immaturity can coexist with all the trappings of
adult life and a confident and knowledgeable manner.

It may be a long time into a love affair or working relationship before we
realise that we are unwittingly dealing with an emotional neophyte.

It pays, therefore, to try to arrive at a few general guidelines for how an
emotionally immature person can be spotted and if necessary skirted very fast.

Here are some of the lines that emotionally immature people have tendencies to
come out with in conversation and that should, at the very least, set alarms
ringing.

### I’m not so good at spending time on my own.

What separates the mature from the immature is, perhaps more than anything else,
a capacity for being on their own, without distraction, and thinking about who
they are and what they have experienced.

The mature person can allow themselves to examine and as it were ‘feel’ their
own feelings, even when these are very difficult and hugely unwelcome.

They can stomach an encounter with their own rage, their own envy, their own
shame.

They don’t have to do what the immature person is compelled to do: constantly
find someone or something else to prevent them from any risk of understanding
their own mind.

### I don’t really remember much about my childhood.

There are very few childhoods in which difficult things didn’t unfold.

Without anyone meaning for this to happen, with the best intentions, children’s
development gets impeded and bruised.

What counts therefore isn’t that someone had a ‘happy’ childhood (almost no one
on the planet did entirely), but that a person should have a calm and insightful
view of what their childhood was actually like, in its good and bad aspects.

An inability to remember much about the past doesn’t indicate that it was
idyllic or just ‘a long time ago…’, rather that it hasn’t begun to be processed.

### I’ve never really thought about that before…

Emotionally immature people have great difficulties with conversations that
require them to draw on a knowledge of their own enthusiasms, sorrows, projects
and histories.

So, as one sits with them over a drink and asks, for example, why their last
relationship broke up, or what meaningful work constitutes for them or what they
regret most from childhood, one has an above average chance of hearing (perhaps
quite sweetly) a reply along the lines that this is all too new and that they
have ‘never thought about this before’.

It isn’t that the emotionally immature person is being cagey; they simply
haven’t properly inhabited, in its authentic pain and intensity, the life they
are actually leading.

### Everything is pretty good. It’s fine, all fine…

It would be churlish to begrudge anyone a good mood.

Nevertheless, the emotionally immature person isn’t often just in a good mood,
they are rigidly unable to enter a bad one.

Everything is declared fine (their parents, job, love affair, sex life,
ambitions) because they have no resources for coping with anything that might be
more nuanced and more real, that might entail anger, loss, confusion or wayward
desires.

One comes away from a dialogue with such a person disoriented and lonely at the
idea that any life could be quite so cheerily one-dimensional.

### That’s just a load of old psychobabble…

As soon as a conversation threatens their emotional integrity, the emotionally
immature person will shut it down with the imperious verdict that it is a piece
of over-complicated nonsense.

They appeal to an idea of robust simplicity instead, as though the origins of
all our problems might lie in thinking too much.

It’s the sort of attitude that might lead them to recommend that an anxious
person ‘pull themselves together’ or to claim that a lot of mental distress
comes from not getting out enough.

But of course, none of this stems from confidence: it’s a terrified way of
blocking one’s ears and saying ‘No’ to truths that might hurt very much.

### How to deal with them

Emotionally immature people can be extremely charming and at points entertaining
to be around.

But as a general rule, we’d be advised to give them a very wide berth indeed and
aim to check in on them in a decade or two.

Life is in the end far too short, far too interesting and far too lonely to
spend very long around people who lack any interest in trying to be, where it
counts, emotional grown ups.
